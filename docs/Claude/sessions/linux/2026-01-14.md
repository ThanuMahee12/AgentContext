## Project: data-alchemy

**Repo:** alchmy (parent) + data-alchemy (submodule)

**Environment:** Linux machine

### Progress Today

**Session 1:**
- Session started
- Working on `feature/bbocax-futures` branch
- Cleared bronze/silver/platinum for fresh backfill
- Reviewed grabber map (4 patterns: shareFuturesBulk, nonShareFuturesBulk)

**Session 2:**
- Pulled AgentContext updates (new folder structure from Windows)
- Migrated `l-2026-01-13.md` → `linux/2026-01-13.md`
- Reorganized notes structure:
  - `notes/index.md` → main TOC
  - `notes/projects/data-alchemy/index.md` → project TOC
  - `notes/projects/data-alchemy/mapping.md` → bbocax approach
- Consolidated bbocax details from all sessions into `mapping.md`:
  - Branch strategy + creation commands
  - File pattern details for all 6 grabber maps
  - Coverage verification (data-alchemy vs sf-migration)
  - Decrypt inclusion logic
  - Platinum output patterns

### Next

- Run pipeline with backfill (user running manually)
- Verify gold output matches shovel structure
- Run DQ validation
- Commit and push data-alchemy changes
