  "summary": "Pattern-based reverse lookup for data pipelines + Notion service tracking. When a file is missing in Gold/Platinum, trace back to Bronze source, Service, and Server. Core idea: track patterns not files. Includes full entity relationships, layer definitions (raw→bronze→silver→gold→raw_enriched→delta), CLI ideas (invdb reverse/service/servers/trace/impact), and Notion integration with alchemy_service and alchemy_server databases.",
